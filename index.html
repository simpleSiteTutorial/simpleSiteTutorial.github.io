		<!-- Here we add Javascript (JS) directly into the HTML using <script>, similar to how we did with CSS in the last example with <style>. We can also replace this with a <link> to an external js file just like we did with the CSS in the <head> above! With Javascript we can do all kinds of interesting things, interactivity, API calling (to get data, etc from another website such as YouTube), communicating to and from servers, animations, etc.. The sky is the limit here, especially if you use JS libraries and frameworks that make it easy for you! -->
		<script>
			// Here we create a variable to refer to the "earthImage" using its ID
			var earthImage = document.getElementById("earthImage");
			var repeatingEvent = setInterval(animation, 500);
			var degrees = 0;

			function animation() {
				degrees += 90;
				earthImage.style.transform = 'rotate('+degrees+'deg)';
